## Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE) Analysis Pipeline & Colony Counter Spotting Mod
This repository contains:
* a pipeline to analyze growth curve data collected from ALE experiments to plot and calculate values such as MIC, carrying capacity, and growth rate.
* a modified version of CoCo, an image processing pipeline that counts colonies from spotting assays.
